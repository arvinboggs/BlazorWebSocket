## Blazor WebAssembly + ASP.NET chat web app using WebSocket

This Blazor WebAssembly and ASP.NET project is a chat web application that demonstrates the use of WebSockets. 

The core components of the project are located in 2 files: `\Client\WebSocketClientConnection.cs` (for the client-side) and `\Server\Controllers\WebSocketsController.cs` (for the server-side). 

The following article will provide a comprehensive guide on implementing WebSocket into your own project using these files.
